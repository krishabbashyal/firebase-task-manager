## Local Setup Steps:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project uses `v18.17.0`, but any recent version should work.
After verifying Node.js, run the following command to install all required project dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Create a .env file in the project's root folder. Store the credentials for the Supabase server that powers the application's backend in this file, you will have to reach out to someone for this.

Once the above steps are done, you can run the following command to launch the application on your localhost:

Once that has been created, you will have to create a .env file in the root of the project folder. This will be where we store the credentials to the supabase server that is powering the backend of this application. 

Once those two steps are completed you can run:

```
npm run serve
```
You can explore different routes by checking the main.js file in the root directory.
